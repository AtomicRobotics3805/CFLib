 * This class manages the controls for TeleOp OpModes. In your project, you should create your own
 * Controls class that inherits from this one and overrides the registerCommands function. If you
 * want to register a command, type a line into registerCommands with the following format:
 * gamepad.button.command = Subsystem.command
 * For example, that could look like this:
 * gamepad1.a.startCommand = Lift.toHigh
 * If you used the line above, then whenever you pressed the "a" button on gamepad1 it would move
 * the lift to the high position.
