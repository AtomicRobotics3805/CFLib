 * A subsystem represents any mechanism on the robot that cannot be used by two things at once. It
 * serves two purposes: first, the CommandScheduler prevents more than one command from using a
 * subsystem at a time, and second, the CommandScheduler runs the periodic and inUsePeriodic
 * functions every loop.
 *
 * P.S. I know that the name of an interface is supposed to be an adjective, so if someone could
 * help me turn the word subsystem into an adjective that would be greatly appreciated.
