/**
 * All Competition Autonomous OpModes should inherit from this class. It performs several tasks that
 * all Auto programs need to do. Each competition OpMode only needs to pass parameters to the
 * constructor - it doesn't need to have a body.
 * @param color the color of the alliance
 * @param trajectoryFactory the trajectory factory that contains start positions and trajectories
 * @param mainRoutine a lambda returning the main routine that needs to be performed after the play
 *                    button is pressed. This routine should be declared in a separate Routines
 *                    class.
 * @param initRoutine a lambda returning the routine that needs to be performed during
 *                    initialization. This routine should also be declared in a separate Routines
 *                    class.
 * @param drive the robot's drivetrain subsystem
 * @param subsystems each of the subsystems used by the robot. One of these should be a drivetrain
 *                   and the others should be mechanisms.
