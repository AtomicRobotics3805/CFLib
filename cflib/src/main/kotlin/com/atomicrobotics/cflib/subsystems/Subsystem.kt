 * subsystem at a time, and second, the CommandScheduler runs the periodic and inUsePeriodic
 * functions every loop.
 *
 * P.S. I know that the name of an interface is supposed to be an adjective, so if someone could
 * help me turn the word subsystem into an adjective that would be greatly appreciated.
