/**
 * This class contains all the RoadRunner trajectories and start positions in the project. It's

 * The coordinate system for Road Runner is as follows:
 * Positive x is up, negative x is down, positive y is right, negative y is left, positive angles
 * are counterclockwise. All measurements are in inches and radians.
