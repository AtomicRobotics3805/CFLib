/**
 * This object contains various "constant" values used by other classes. This object is not strictly

 * places. The word "constant" is used lightly because the variables in this class are not constants
 * in the strict sense. They can change between OpModes, but stay the same during each OpMode. The
 * first thing that an OpMode should do is assign values to these variables. Otherwise, many classes
 * will break.
