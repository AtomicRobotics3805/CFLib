# Contributing to CFLib

First off, thanks for taking the time to look into contributing!

If you're new to open source software, we'll take a moment to explain it.

CFLib is an open source project. That means anyone can add features, fix bugs, edit code, or do [almost] whatever they want.

That's awesome, right!?

Even better is that they can actually contribute those changes *to the source* and benefit everyone who uses it!

You can contribute however you'd like: issues, bug reports, feature requests, bug fixes, adding features... whatever!

However, we are not obligated to merge your changes into the project. 

When contributing to CFLib, please use the `dev` branch as the *compare* branch for your PR. 

When the `dev` branch is determined to be stable, it will be merged into the `main` branch and a release will be created.
