/**
 * Sometimes, you may want to use a very simple command and don't want to create a whole class for
 * it. To avoid that, you can use this class and pass in any necessary functionality as constructor
 * parameters.
 * @param getDone equivalent of _isDone, determines whether the command is done. Always true by
 *                default, meaning that if this isn't set, the command will run start() and then
 *                finish immediately
 * @param _execute equivalent of execute(), run every loop, does nothing by default
 * @param _start equivalent of start(), runs once at the command's start, does nothing by default
 * @param _done equivalent of end(), runs once at the command's end, does nothing by default
 * @param endTime the amount of time required for the command to finish (in addition to getDone
 *                being true). This is 0.0 by default, meaning that unless you set this, getDone is
 *                the only thing used to determine if the command is finished
 * @param requirements a list of subsystems used by this command
 * @param interruptible whether or not this command can be interrupted by other commands using the
 *                      same subsystem(s)
