/**
 * This class is an example of an intake controlled by a single motor. Its first two commands, start and stop, turn the
 * motor off and on. The third command, switch, starts it if it's off and stops if it's on. The switch command is
 * particularly useful during TeleOp.
 * If you want, you can also use this class for other mechanisms that also involve one motor, especially those that
 * don't require encoders.
 * To use this class, copy it into the proper package and change the two constants.
